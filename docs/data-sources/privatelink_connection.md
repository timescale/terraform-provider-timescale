  Looks up an existing Azure Private Link connection.
  Use this data source to reference a connection that was created outside of Terraform
  or in a different Terraform workspace. You can look up by connection_id or by
  azure_connection_name and region.
  Example Usage
  Look up by connection ID
  
  data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
    connection_id = "conn-123"
  }
  
  Look up by Azure connection name

# timescale_privatelink_connection (Data Source)

Looks up an existing Azure Private Link connection.

Use this data source to reference a connection that was created outside of Terraform
or in a different Terraform workspace. You can look up by `connection_id` or by
`azure_connection_name` and `region`.

## Example Usage

### Look up by connection ID

```hcl
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
  connection_id = "conn-123"
}
```

### Look up by Azure connection name

```hcl
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_name" {
  azure_connection_name = "my-private-endpoint"
  region                = "az-eastus2"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up an existing Private Link connection by connection ID
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
  connection_id = "conn-123"
}

# Or look up by Azure connection name and region
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_name" {
  azure_connection_name = "my-private-endpoint"
  region                = "az-eastus2"
}

output "connection_ip" {
  value = data.timescale_privatelink_connection.by_id.ip_address
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `azure_connection_name` (String) The Azure private endpoint name to match. Azure formats the connection name as '<pe-name>.<guid>', so this matches connections where the name starts with this value followed by a dot.
- `connection_id` (String) The unique identifier for the connection. Either this or azure_connection_name+region must be provided.
- `region` (String) The Timescale region (e.g., az-eastus2). Required when using azure_connection_name.

### Read-Only

- `ip_address` (String) The private IP address of the Azure Private Endpoint.
- `link_identifier` (String) The Azure private link identifier.
- `name` (String) The display name for the connection.
- `state` (String) The state of the connection (e.g., APPROVED, PENDING).
- `subscription_id` (String) The Azure subscription ID.
