  Looks up an existing Private Link connection.
  Use this data source to reference a connection that was created outside of Terraform
  or in a different Terraform workspace. You can look up by connection_id or by
  provider_connection_id, cloud_provider, and region.
  Example Usage
  Look up by connection ID
  
  data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
    connection_id = "conn-123"
  }
  
  Look up by provider connection ID

# timescale_privatelink_connection (Data Source)

Looks up an existing Private Link connection.

Use this data source to reference a connection that was created outside of Terraform
or in a different Terraform workspace. You can look up by `connection_id` or by
`provider_connection_id`, `cloud_provider`, and `region`.

## Example Usage

### Look up by connection ID

```hcl
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
  connection_id = "conn-123"
}
```

### Look up by provider connection ID

```hcl
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_provider_id" {
  provider_connection_id = "my-private-endpoint"
  cloud_provider         = "AZURE"
  region                 = "az-eastus2"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up an existing Private Link connection by connection ID
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_id" {
  connection_id = "conn-123"
}

# Or look up by Azure connection name and region
data "timescale_privatelink_connection" "by_name" {
  azure_connection_name = "my-private-endpoint"
  region                = "az-eastus2"
}

output "connection_ip" {
  value = data.timescale_privatelink_connection.by_id.ip_address
}
```
