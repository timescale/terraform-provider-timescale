# timescale_log_exporter (Resource)

Schema for a log exporter.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    timescale = {
      source  = "timescale/timescale"
      version = "~> 2.4"
    }
  }
}

# Authenticate using client credentials.
# They are issued through the Timescale UI.
# When required, they will exchange for a short-lived JWT to do the calls.
provider "timescale" {
  project_id = var.ts_project_id
  access_key = var.ts_access_key
  secret_key = var.ts_secret_key
}

variable "ts_project_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "ts_access_key" {
  type = string
}

variable "ts_secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

resource "timescale_log_exporter" "my_cloudwatch_exporter_with_role" {
  name   = "CloudWatch Log Exporter via IAM Role from TF"
  region = "us-east-1"

  cloudwatch = {
    region          = "us-east-1"
    role_arn        = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLogsExporterRole"
    log_group_name  = "/myapplication/logs"
    log_stream_name = "exporter-stream-role"
  }
}

  name   = "CloudWatch Log Exporter via Static Keys"
  region = "us-east-1"

    log_group_name  = "/anotherapplication/logs"
    log_stream_name = "exporter-stream-keys"
  }
}

# Create a service and attach one of the exporters (only 1 log exporter can be attached at the same time)
resource "timescale_service" "log_exporter_test" {
  name            = "log_exporter_test"
  milli_cpu       = 1000
  memory_gb       = 4
