# timescale_privatelink_connection (Resource)

Manages a Private Link connection in a Timescale project.

This resource discovers an existing Private Link connection (created via Azure Private Endpoint
or AWS VPC Endpoint) and allows you to configure its IP address and name.

## Workflow

### Azure
1. Create an Azure Private Endpoint pointing to the Timescale Private Link Service
2. Use this resource with `provider_connection_id` set to the private endpoint name and `cloud_provider = "azure"`
3. The resource will sync and wait for the connection to appear
4. Set `ip_address` to the private IP from the Azure Private Endpoint

### AWS
1. Create an AWS VPC Endpoint pointing to the Timescale VPC Endpoint Service
2. Use this resource with `provider_connection_id` set to the VPC Endpoint ID and `cloud_provider = "aws"`
3. The resource will sync and find the connection

## Schema

### Required

- `cloud_provider` (String) The cloud provider: azure or aws.
- `ip_address` (String) The private IP address of the Private Endpoint or VPC Endpoint. Required to enable services to connect via this private link.
- `provider_connection_id` (String) The cloud provider connection identifier. For Azure: the private endpoint name. For AWS: the VPC Endpoint ID (vpce-...).
- `region` (String) The Timescale region (e.g., az-eastus2, us-east-1).

### Optional

- `name` (String) Optional display name for the connection.
- `timeout` (String) How long to wait for the connection to appear during create. Accepts duration strings like '2m', '5m', '30s'. Defaults to '2m'.

### Read-Only

- `connection_id` (String) The unique identifier for this connection. Use this for timescale_service.private_endpoint_connection_id.
- `id` (String) Resource identifier (same as connection_id).
- `link_identifier` (String) The private link identifier.
- `state` (String) The state of the connection (e.g., approved, pending).
