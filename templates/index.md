# Timescale Terraform Provider
The Terraform provider for [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/cloud).

## Requirements
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0

## Quick Start

### Authorization
When you log in to your [Timescale Account](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/), navigate to the `Project settings` page.
From here, you can create client credentials for programmatic usage. Click the `Create credentials` button to generate a new public/secret key pair.

### Project ID
The project ID can be found from the `Services` dashboard. In the upper right-hand side of the page, click on the three vertical dots to view the project ID.

Create a `main.tf` configuration file with the following content.
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    timescale = {
      source  = "timescale/timescale"
      version = "x.y.z"
    }
  }
}

# Authenticate using client credentials.
# They are issued through the Timescale UI.
# When required, they will exchange for a short-lived JWT to do the calls.
provider "timescale" {
  project_id = var.ts_project_id
  access_key = var.ts_access_key
  secret_key = var.ts_secret_key
}

variable "ts_project_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "ts_access_key" {
  type = string
}

variable "ts_secret_key" {
  type = string
}

resource "timescale_service" "test" {
  # name       = ""
  # milli_cpu  = 500
  # memory_gb  = 2
  # region_code = "us-east-1"
  # enable_ha_replica = false
  # timeouts = {
  #   create = '30m'
  # }
}
```
